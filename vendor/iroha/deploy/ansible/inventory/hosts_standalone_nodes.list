# This is sample inventory file for deployment using docker-compose (multiple nodes of iroha on target hosts)
# To start with:
# 1) set group name (not mandatory, you can use already predefined): e.g. [iroha-nodes].
# 2) change inventory hostname (not mandatory, you can use already predefined): e.g. iroha-1.
# 3) set IP address to the address of your server ("ansible_host" variable)
# 4) set "ansible_user", or leave "root"
# 5) set "key" variable in the following way:
# key=0 for the first host of the first node in the inventory
# for next host set key=key[prev_host] + 1
# NOTE: 1) you can create more than one group, but you still have to increment it throughout the inventory file.
