# This is sample inventory file for deployment using docker-compose (multiple nodes of iroha on target hosts)
# To start with:
# 1) set group name (not mandatory, you can use already predefined): e.g. [iroha-east].
# 2) change inventory hostname (not mandatory, you can use already predefined): e.g. iroha-bench1.
# 3) set IP address to the address of your server ("ansible_host" variable)
# 4) set "ansible_user", or leave "root"
# 5) set "key" variable in the following way:
# key=0 for the first host of the first node in the inventory
# in playbook/<playbook name>/group_vars/all.yml or playbook/<playbook name>/group_vars/<group name>.yml
# you can find parameter "nodes_in_group"
# NOTE: that <group name>.yml values have higher priority than in all.yml
# for next host set key=key[prev_host] + nodes_in_group
# repeat this procedure for all other hosts
# NOTE: 1) you can add more than one host to each group
# NOTE: 2) you can set unique value of "nodes_in_group" for each host by setting it in
# playbook/<playbook name>/host_vars/<host name>/all.yml
