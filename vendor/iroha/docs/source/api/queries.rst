Queries
=======

A query is a request related to certain part of World State View — the latest state of blockchain.
Query cannot modify the contents of the chain and a response is returned
to any client immediately after receiving peer has processed a query.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

The validation for all queries includes:

- timestamp — shouldn't be from the past (24 hours prior to the peer time) or from the future (range of 5 minutes added to the peer time)
- signature of query creator — used for checking the identity of query creator
- query counter — checked to be incremented with every subsequent query from query creator
- roles — depending on the query creator's role: the range of state available to query can relate to to the same account, account in the domain, to the whole chain, or not allowed at all

    "Balance", "balance of the asset", "Not less than 0", "200.20"

Get Account Detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

To get details of the account, `GetAccountDetail` query can be used. Account details are key-value pairs, splitted into writers categories. Writers are accounts, which added the corresponding account detail. Example of such structure is:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

Here, one can see four account details - "age", "hobbies" and "sports" - added by two writers - "account@a_domain" and "account@b_domain". All of these details, obviously, are about the same account.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetAccountDetail {
      oneof opt_account_id {
        string account_id = 1;
      }
      oneof opt_key {
        string key = 2;
      }
      oneof opt_writer {
        string writer = 3;
      }
    }

.. note::
    Pay attention, that all fields are optional. Reasons will be described later.

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

        "Account ID", "account id to get details from", "<account_name>@<domain_id>", "account@domain"
        "Key", "key, under which to get details", "string", "age"
        "Writer", "account id of writer", "<account_name>@<domain_id>", "account@domain"

Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message AccountDetailResponse {
      string detail = 1;
    }

Response Structure
------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

        "Detail", "key-value pairs with account details", "JSON", "see below"

Usage Examples
--------------

Let's again consider the example of details from the beginning and see, how different variants of `GetAccountDetail` queries will change the resulting response.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id is not set**

If account_id is not set - other fields can be empty or not - it will automatically be substituted with query creator's account, which will lead to one of the next cases.

**only account_id is set**

In this case, all details about that account are going to be returned, leading to the following response:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id and key are set**

Here, details added by all writers under the key are going to be returned. For example, if we asked for the key "age", that's the response we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20
        }
    }

**account_id and writer are set**

Now, the response will contain all details about this account, added by one specific writer. For example, if we asked for writer "account@b_domain", we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id, key and writer are set**

Lastly, if all three field are set, result will contain details, added the specific writer and under the specific key, for example, if we asked for key "age" and writer "account@a_domain", we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18
        }
    }
