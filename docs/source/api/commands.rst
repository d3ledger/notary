Commands
========

A command changes the state, called World State View, by performing an action over an entity (asset, account) in the system.
Any command should be included in a transaction to perform an action.

Add asset quantity
------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

The purpose of add asset quantity command is to increase the quantity of an asset on account of transaction creator.
Use case scenario is to increase the number of a mutable asset in the system, which can act as a claim on a commodity (e.g. money, gold, etc.)

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message AddAssetQuantity {
        string asset_id = 1;
        Amount amount = 2;
    }

    message uint256 {
        uint64 first = 1;
        uint64 second = 2;
        uint64 third = 3;
        uint64 fourth = 4;
    }

    message Amount {
        uint256 value = 1;
        uint32 precision = 2;
    }

.. note::
    Please note that due to a known issue you would not get any exception if you pass invalid precision value.
    Valid range is: 0 <= precision <= 255


Structure
^^^^^^^^^
